Grilo lua sources
=================

grilo-lua-sources contains sources for the grilo media
discovery framework, implementing support for a variety
of sources.

Sources that are of good quality and well maintained will
eventually be merged into the upstream grilo-plugins
repository.

The repository also includes companion libquvi scripts for
libquvi 0.9, that will be used by some of the sources to
get the media URL, given a web page URL.
